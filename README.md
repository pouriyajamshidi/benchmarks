# Benchmarks

These days, almost all benchmarks out there are extremely unrealistic (check their source code) and not representative of real world applications. So I decided to write my own benchmarks to find an answer suitable for me.

This repo hosts the benchmarks of real world applications that I write in different languages to compare and pick the right tool for the task at hand. I also include `developer time` in the benchamrks to give a rough idea and shed some light on **machine** vs **developer** time.

I try to make all the versions as close as possible to each other, not give an unfair advantage to a language with a certain feature.

Here is the list of current benchmarks:

1. [Anagram](anagram_go_nim_vs_python/README.md) comparing Python, Go and Nim.
2. IPTABLES monitor on +6 million lines of log (TBD).

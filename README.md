# Benchmarks

This repo hosts the benchmarks of real world applications that I write in different languages to compare and pick the right tool for the task at hand.

These days, almost all benchmarks out there are extremely unrealistic (check their source code) and not representative of real world applications. So I decided to write my own benchmarks to find an answer suitable for me.

I try to make all the versions as close as possible to not give an unfair advantage to a language.

Here is the list of current benchmarks:

1. [Anagram](anagram_go_nim_vs_python/README.md) comparing Python, Go and Nim.
